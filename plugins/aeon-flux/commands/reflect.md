# Reflect Command

Pause and evaluate current approach and progress.

## Reflection Questions

Answer each briefly:

1. **Progress**: Am I making forward progress or looping?
2. **Approach**: Is this the right approach or should I pivot?
3. **Blockers**: What's preventing faster progress?
4. **Patterns**: Am I repeating mistakes?
5. **Next**: What's the single most important next action?

## Reflection Format

```markdown
## Reflection

**Progress**: [Forward/Stalled/Looping]
**Assessment**: [1-2 sentences on current state]

**Blockers**:
- [Blocker 1 if any]
- [Blocker 2 if any]

**Patterns Noticed**:
